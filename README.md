# Websraping-using-Beautiful-soup

Welcome to my web scraping project using BeautifulSoup! In this repository, you'll find Python scripts for scraping data from **AmbitionBox** using the BeautifulSoup library and saving the extracted data into CSV files.

# Overview
Web scraping is a powerful technique for extracting data from websites, enabling us to gather valuable information for analysis, research, or other purposes. In this project, I've utilized the BeautifulSoup library, a popular Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents, to scrape data from various websites.

# Features
* BeautifulSoup Usage: Utilized the BeautifulSoup library to navigate and extract data from HTML documents.
* CSV Export: Saved the extracted data into CSV files for further analysis and visualization.
* Customizable: Easily adaptable scripts for scraping different websites by modifying the HTML tags and structure as needed.
* Documentation: Included detailed comments within the Python scripts to explain the scraping process and data extraction logic.
